Kevin used the SBL04 motors from Namiki for the Triad drives.
These are no longer manufactured. He has a small number of spares.
The datasheet is for the SBL07 through SBL12 motors.
These are three-phase stepper motors, it looks like.

Update:
Kevin says they're brushless DC motors, not steppers. The UVW inputs take
sine waves 120 degrees out of phase from each other, with the phase order
determining the motor directions, at +/- 3V.

Update again:
He didn't use the "04" motors; those are 4mm diameter. The ones in the
drives are 7mm.
