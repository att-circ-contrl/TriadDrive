They're now "Adamant-Namiki", and are selling the 7mm motor and reduction
gears that Kevin used again.

The motor is BMN07-1207 (12mm long, 7 ohms resistance).
The reduction gear is SPG07-105 (105x reduction; this is 12mm long).
Kevin did not go for the encoder add-on (that'd be another 6-7 mm long).

The planetary gear's output shaft is 1.5mm diameter with a D profile.

Kevin made the screw side of the coupler by cutting a slot in a 4mm diameter
#0-80 threaded stand-off (or milling and tapping 4mm stock).

Kevin made the motor side of the coupler by cutting a length of brass or
bronze bar stock, drilling a 1.5mm hole axially, and then using a punch to
crimp it on to the flat part of the shaft (there's a circular depression
where he did this).
