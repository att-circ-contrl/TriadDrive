# Womelsdorf Lab probe drives bug list, feature requests, and abbreviated changelog.


## Near-term to-do list:

* Make a model of the Kevin drive's tungsten clips. (done? check this)

* Make printable versions of the long-reach Atlas silicon arms with tighter
clearances. (r2 done; need r3 with closer trenches)

* Make a detailed explanation of how to compute bending strain, per my
notes from 23 May 2022 p2. Or just scan that page.

* Fix broken object body links for close short arms and close long atlas
arms. They should point to the version before the marker, to not be sensitive
to the number of marker dots. (done? check this)

* For the close-spaced Atlas drive's guide, shorten the lid's middle pedestal
so that the side rods can be snug when it's tightened. Also narrow the middle
trench slightly.


## Long-term to-do list:

* Consider removing this document, since it's not kept up-to-date.


## Abbreviated changelog:

* 30 June 2022 --
Release milestone with all drives and accessories at least nominally working.

* 5 May 2022 --
Release milestone with all relevant files from my old dev tree moved to the
repository.

* 4 May 2022 --
Milestone with my old "cad" folder emptied out. Still need to deal with the
"specs" folder, and consider porting more old "from isaac" material.

* 30 Mar 2022 --
Rearranged project files into something resembling a sensible tree. Created
initial repository.


_This is the end of the file._
