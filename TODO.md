## Long-term to-do list:


## Abbreviated changelog:

* 4 May 2022 --
Milestone with my old "cad" folder emptied out. Still need to deal with the
"specs" folder, and consider porting more old "from isaac" material.

* 30 Mar 2022 --
Rearranged project files into something resembling a sensible tree. Created
initial repository.


_This is the end of the file._
