## Abbreviated changelog:

* 5 May 2022 --
Release milestone with all relevant files from my old dev tree moved to the
repository.

Milestone with my old "cad" folder emptied out. Still need to deal with the
"specs" folder, and consider porting more old "from isaac" material.

* 30 Mar 2022 --
Rearranged project files into something resembling a sensible tree. Created
initial repository.


_This is the end of the file._
