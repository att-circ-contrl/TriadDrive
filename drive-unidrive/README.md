# Minimal Single-Probe Drive

## Overview

This was a proof-of-concept design for a drive that uses the same principles
as the Triad drive and the same motors, but with parts that are easier to
make and to assemble.

The prototype worked, but we need to hold probes with higher density than
this drive allows.


## Notes

Miscellaneous notes:

* The parts are all intended to be compatible with 3-axis machining. Some
parts will need to be re-mounted so that they can be machined from multiple
directions.

* I've added vent holes perpendicular to most of what would otherwise be
blind threaded holes, to make tapping easier.

* Kevin brazed the threaded rod to a brass coupler and used an arbor press
and punch to crimp another brass coupler to the motor's "D"-profile rod. I'm
using couplers that are large enough to a) use set screws and b) be 3d-printed
without being too weak. The end of the threaded rod gets filed to a
"D"-profile so that the set screw can grab it securely.

* The middle segment of the coupler is intended to tolerate off-axis
misalignment between the motor and the threaded rod. An alternative would
be to make one of the outer coupler pieces male and to omit the middle piece.
There's enough clearance between mating surfaces to tolerate +/- 0.1mm of
misalignment without needing the middle piece.
