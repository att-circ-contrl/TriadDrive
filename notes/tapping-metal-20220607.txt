Notes for tapping M1 threads in 3d printed steel clips:

- As soon as there's _any_ resistance (about half a turn of cutting), back
  off half a turn to a full turn.
- If there's still resistance when resuming after that, back all the way
  out and clear chps with canned air.

This was for relatively shallow holes (1mm deep).

This should work for brass, aluminum, and 3d printed 316 steel. It may not
work with hard steel (heat-treated printed 17PH, machined steel parts, etc).
