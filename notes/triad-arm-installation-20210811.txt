[From 11 August 2021 notes.]

- Test the fit on the girder first, but also with the girder hand-seated in
  the body (for clearance with the side arms). Arms should move freely after
  initial friction. Greasing is okay.

- Drill the hole wider (to 90% #0-80 rather than 80%).
- Tap it and clear chips.
- Put a drop of oil on the hole.
- Test it with a 1/4" #0-80 screw. If there's _any_ friction at any point,
  tap it again. Repeat as necessary.

- Line up all three arms in your work area so that you know which go on which
  threaded rods. Check with the girder if unsure. The girder's flat end is at
  the bottom of the drive.

- Make sure the drive rods are free of dust.
- Put a drop of oil on the end of a drive rod.
- Tell the rod to advance upwards 10mm.
- When it starts this, hold the rod near the end to keep it from wobbling.
  Greased gloves help (they'll already be greasy, don't worry).
- Carefully orient the arm and feed it on to the rod. If it's cross-threaded,
  let go _immediately_ and hit the "stop" button. Advance down to unthread.
- This is easier if you have two people, so that one person can manually hold
  the "advance up/down" buttons instead of telling it to auto-advance.

- After feeding all three arms on to the end of the drive, add the girder and
  then reassemble the drive foot and body.
- Feed the arms back down to the bottom and set the location to 50mm.
- Feed the arms up to 5mm. Add oil to the threaded rods if they look dry at
  any point of this. Better to have too much oil than to have arms binding.
- Feed the arms back down to loading positions. They need to be staggered so
  that the screws on all of them are accessible (e.g. 35/40/45 mm).
- If the drive has enough oil to actually be dripping, blot the excess with
  paper towel. Check very carefully that no paper fibers are fouling threads.
