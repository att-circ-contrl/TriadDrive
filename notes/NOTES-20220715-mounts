The mounting clips and cable mounts that hold the Triad drives to their
mounting posts should be secured with hex-drive screws, not Phillips screws.

Phillips screws require a lot of axial force to keep the screwdriver securely
seated, which will move the drive. Hex-drive screws don't need any axial
force (just torque).

I've been following Kevin's lead and using socket-head screws and washers
for this. Button-head screws are available but have much less surface area,
so they'd still need washers (no advantage).
