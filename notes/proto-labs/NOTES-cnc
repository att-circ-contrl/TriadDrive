Proto Labs strictly only uses ball end mills and flat end mills. Among other
things this means objects can't have dovetails (at least not sharp ones).

Minimum size is 1/4" by 1/4" by about 0.04" (so, 7x7x1 mm).

They seem to only machine from orthogonal directions (XYZ axis directions),
and usually not from all 6 directions on any given piece. This means certain
concave corners that could be sharp will be rounded if they chose to machine
them from an inconvenient direction.

The "MyRapid" service is a bit more negotiable, but will be more expensive
and will have added lead time for talking to them about your design.
