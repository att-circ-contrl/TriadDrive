Additional design requirements/notes:

- While being able to remove guide tubes individually is useful, having
a layout with minimum vertical space (for maximum DBC probe reach) is more
useful. Hence the "1pc" guide tube clamp variant.

- Adam reports that it's useful to be able to tighten the screws holding the
Kevin clips to the arms without removing the arms. These screws can come
loose during use. It's hard to tighten these on 45 degree arms.

- Having arm and guide tube holder sets that are custom-tailored to a
specific experiment's positions is acceptable.
