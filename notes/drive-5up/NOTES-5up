This drive dates from 2017 or earlier. Each of the arms had a pair of slits
for holding probes, and a foot was used that had mounts for 5 linearly spaced
guide tubes plus one extra central guide tube.

The foot was made by EDM. I have no idea how Kevin made the arms; it would
have taken a very narrow slitting saw. The foot I examined showed permanent
distortion due to clamping, so I'm guessing it didn't work very well.
