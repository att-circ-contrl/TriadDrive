Additional notes regarding small screws:

- McMaster-Carr stocks #00-90 and #000-120 screws, which may be useful
  alternatives to M1.


- M1 is available as slotted drive only.
- We can get flat-head M1 down to 3 mm, and cheese-head M1 down to 2 mm.


- #00-90 has a nominal shank diameter of 1.19 mm.
- I don't think this is a useful size when #000 is also available.
- By comparison, #0-80 has a nominal shank diameter of 1.52 mm.


- #000-120 has a nominal shank diameter of 0.86 mm.
- Flat-head and filister-head slotted and go down to 3/32" (2.4 mm).
- Button-head "torx plus" (IP1/T1) goes down to 1/16" (1.6 mm).
- (Pan-head torx only goes to 1/8".)
