To tap 3d printed plastic arms without damage:

- Use the 3/64" (#0 tap) drill to widen the holes.
- Start tapping. As soon as there's resistance, _stop_ and back out.
- Use canned air to clean the tap and clear the hole.
- Resume tapping. As soon as there's resistance, _stop_ and back out.
- Repeat the above steps until the hole is fully tapped.
- Clean the tap and clear the hole, and then run the tap through the hole
  again for a finishing pass.
- Clean the tap and clear the hole, and use a #0-80 screw to test the hole.
  The screw should engage easily with no resistance at any point.

Tapping too aggressively does the following:

- The side-walls bulge out. Best-case they'll need to be filed down, and
  in the worst case they'll break (prints are weak and walls are thin).
- The side-walls will apply pressure, squeezing the screw. This will cause
  the arm to get stuck on the drive screw.

.. The procedure outlined above will eliminate these problems.

It's a good idea to use a similar procedure with harder materials, too. It's
also important to back out and break chips when working with, e.g., PEEK.
