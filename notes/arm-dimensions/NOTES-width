Arms that aren't wide enough will wobble (yaw) when driven. This can be
enough to cause conflict between probes or to endanger Atlas probes.

Arms with trenches that are too wide will jam on the girder if they tilt
(pitch) for any reason. As soon as they tilt a small amount, friction
increases and they tilt more. This mostly happens with the middle arm.



Use the "wide"/"thick" variants of the arms to avoid wobble. These have arm
widths of 2.90 mm / 2.35 mm.

Use the FIXME variants of the arms to avoid jamming. These have trench
widths of FIXME mm.
