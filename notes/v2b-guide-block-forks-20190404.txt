Post-mortem on the v1 adapter and mount:


- Guide block trenches need to be flared at the bottom to avoid catching on
holes in the rods. Maybe flare at the top too.

- Guide block rounded cutout needs to be 2mm higher, for full range of motion
of the arms.

- _Maybe_ make arms 1mm shorter, for easier tapping? Kevin made ones this
long, though.

- Carrier arms are slightly large. This seems to be resin tolerances rather
than drawing issues, but they'll still be a very tight fit.



- Posts have trouble seating in the adapter. The posts are slightly wide
and the trench is slightly narrow. For Shapeways prototypes, adjust both.

- Post base should be slightly longer than the clamp inset/clamp inset
should be slightly deeper, so that the washer does not hold the post in
place.

- Mount arm-clamp needs to be a tighter fit around the post. Right now
there's 0.2 mm clearance, and it can't tighten enough to grip with that,
even with plastic flexing.

- Threading exit holes in the crescent need to be 1/8" farther back, for
longer threaded holes.



This is the end of the file.
