Cable/board mounts should have clearance between themselves and the drive,
and around the sides of the mounting post. Only the back of the post contacts
the board mounts.

The board mount serves the same purpose as the drive mount clip: holding the
post against the drive. The slot for the post in the drive is precisely
machined to match the post dimensions (this was Kevin's work; we can't
easily duplicate that).

The board mount should not flex, as that allows the drive to flex (mostly
in the yaw direction). Print board mounts out of a very rigid material.
