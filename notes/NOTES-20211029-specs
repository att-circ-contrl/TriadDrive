Miscellaneous Triad drive specifications:

- Probes need to be positioned as close as possible to the wall of the
  chamber (on the drive side). So, the version "b" foot was bad, and the
  guide tube holder for the version "c" drive was also bad. Ideally no part
  of the drive projects into the chamber (just the guide tubes).

- Having orange-wedge profiles and having limited projection in _front_ of
  the drives helps with packing multiple drives close together, but I haven't
  gotten much user feedback about that.

- The foot _height_ should be kept to a minimum, as it represents wasted
  probe length. The chamber is 15-25 mm deep as well (more wasted length).

- Having probes close together is good. 1mm spacing is ideal; 2mm is still
  helpful.

- Being able to independently remove guide tubes while keeping the others
  fixed is important. Otherwise it's hard to guarantee that a probe is
  reaching the same target even though the probe itself remains fixed.

- Metal parts are strongly discouraged. Bridging guide tubes together risks
  adding noise, and even per-guide-tube clips may add noise. Ring terminals
  for connecting reference lines were discouraged as well, since debugging
  noise usually involves moving the reference around (easier to do with
  alligator clips to guide tubes).

- The bottom of the drive needs to be sterilizable. Blood will come up the
  guide tubes on rare occasions. It should at least be _cleanable_; Delrin
  parts can only tolerate alcohol, and alcohol destroys nylon 3d prints.


...Life will get much easier after finding an EDM vendor that can make
Kevin-style clips.
