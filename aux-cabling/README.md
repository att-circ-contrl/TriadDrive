# Cables and Connectors

## Overview

This folder contains drawings and models for some of the cables and
connectors used with the Triad drives and probes.

This is not a complete list or a complete specification; those are beyond
the scope of this project. The intent is to provide enough information to
allow compatible cable mounts and cabling arrangements to be designed.


## Specific Cables and Connectors

* We use custom headstages built into 128-channel TDT ZIF-clips. A rough
model of a ZC128 clip is provided.

* The "heavy flex" cables are used to connect Atlas and NeuroNexus probes to
ZIF clips (and to provide strain relief). In both cases, the probe is
connected to the heavy flex via a much smaller "thin flex" cable.


## CAD Files

* The "`atlas-flex-2020.fcstd`" CAD file contains a model of the thin-flex
Atlas cable, and an assembly of these cables with the "carrier card" from
the heavy-flex cable. The "carrier card" model is reconstructed from a mesh,
rather than from the original solid model.


_This is the end of the file._
