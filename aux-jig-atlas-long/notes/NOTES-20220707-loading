Unsorted notes from the 7 July 2022 loading tests (and earlier):

Procedure:

- Wear a loupe.
- Mount the Triad drive face-up on the horizontal rod on the mounting stand.
- Install guide tubes.
- Move the middle arm high (high enough for the probe tip to be clear of the
  guide tube with space to spare).
- Move the side arms about 5mm below the middle arm.
- Clamp the rod into the jig.
- Lift the probe out of its case and grab the flange with the big-pad
  tweezers. The big pad will be on the bottom in the jig. The edge of the
  tweezers should line up with the top of the flange (thin flex edge). The
  flange hole area should be clear (don't clamp that).
- Install the probe in the jig. Clamp the tweezers down first, and move the
  heavy flex second (thin flex can be bent to angle the heavy flex).
- Nudge the tweezers (after clamping them) to line up the flange hole.
- Screw the flange to the rod.
- NOTE - For red and yellow, tighten the flange fully. For blue, don't.
- Keeping the thick tweezers in place, turn the jig around, hold the rod and
  flex with your left hand, undo and pull back the rod clip, and open the
  flex clip.
- Grab the tweezers with your right hand and have a helper undo and pull back
  the tweezer clip. This can be done solo if the tweezers are also held with
  the left hand, but holding three things with one hand is tricky.
- Shift the left hand to securely grab the rod and heavy flex.
- Lift the assembly up and set it into the drive.
- NOTE - For the blue rod, don't rotate the assembly; access it from the
  front instead of the back. Rotate the Triad drive stand to allow access
  to the blue side before starting.
- Have an assistant hold the heavy flex.
- Move the rod and tweezers together so that the rod is aligned with the
  M1 hole on the drive arm.
- Have an assistant hold the tweezers and install the M1 screw, or else
  hold the heavy flex and tweezers and have an assistant install the screw.
- Wearing the loupe, sight along the probe shank towards the guide tube.
- Have an assistant slowly advance the drive while manually noodling the
  probe tip into alignment with the guide tube using gentle pressure on the
  tweezers. This will move the screw even if the screw is still tight.
- When the probe tip is close to entering, ask that the speed of the drive
  be reduced.
- When the active area of the probe tip (3mm) is inside the guide tube ask
  that the speed of the drive be returned to normal.
- When several mm of the inactive probe shank are inside the guide tube,
  stop driving, release the tweezers, and loosen the flange screw half a
  turn.
- Resume driving. The probe mounting will be compliant and self-adjust to
  align the shank with the guide tube.
- NOTE - It's impossible to access the blue probe's mounting screw when it's
  in the drive. It has to be loosened in the jig and mounted while loose.
  This makes it much harder to manually line up the probe with the guide
  tube.
- When the probe is far enough down for the heavy flex to be mounted, mount
  the heavy flex. The order matters here: When the yellow probe is installed
  its flex gets mounted on the blue side. Then the red probe is installed
  and its flex is mounted on the inner mount on the red side, followed by
  transferring the yellow probe's flex to the outer mount on the red side.
  Finally the blue probe is installed and its flex is mounted on the blue
  side.
- Keep the red and yellow probes within 3mm of each other vertically to keep
  their flex cables overlapping. It's not catastrophic to cross them, but
  it's still better not to.


Things to change:

- In the jig, widen the trench so that we can grab the flange higher up
  (towards the thin flex) and avoid the silicon shank.
- If possible, mount the blue probe on the other side of its guide rod,
  moving the rod location. This makes the screw accessible. We'll need a
  mirror-flipped jig to set up that rod (this is fine).
- Add more clearance between the rods and the fork's vertical post. As-is the
  middle rod was scraping unless nudged.
- Move the bottom of the guide block up 2mm-3mm so that R/Y/B dots on the
  drive are visible.
- Clips that hold the heavy flex at the sides of the motor would remove the
  need for "here, hold this".
