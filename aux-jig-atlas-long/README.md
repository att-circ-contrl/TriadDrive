# Atlas Probe-Loading Tools for Long-Reach Drives

## Overview

This is a jig and a set of manipulation tools intended for attaching Atlas
probes to the "rectangular rods" used by long-reach drives, and for mounting
the probe-and-rod units into those drives.


## Notes

* The probe needs to be held by its flange, using a padded clamp. If the
flex cable is held instead, the probe bounces around and is very difficult
to control. Attempting to hold the shank will break the probe (they break if
you look at them funny).

* After the two parts are attached, the clamp has to hold the probe to the
rod semi-rigidly to prevent forces on the cable from moving the probe, but
needs to have enough compliance to allow the probe tip to be manually aimed
at the guide tube.

* As with any Atlas probe setup, the M0.5 screw holding the probe needs to
be backed off half a turn so that the probe can move enough to self-align
with the guide tube.
