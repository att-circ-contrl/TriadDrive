Test results from 8 Dec 2021:

- Resin worked better than nylon.
- 1.0 arms with 0.3 bumps and 0.8 arms with 0.5 bumps both worked.
- Clearances in the front/back direction were excessive, but it still worked.
  This was probably due to angled bumps engaging rounded key corners.
- Washers were 1mm thick.

...Provisional plan for future versions is 0.9 arms with 0.4 bumps, and
perhaps 0.1mm less front/back clearance.
