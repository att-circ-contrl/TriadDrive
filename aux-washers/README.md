# Triad Drive Spacer Washers

## Overview

The Triad drives sit on top of 4mm square posts. Coarse adjustment of the
drives' vertical position is done by putting appropriately-sized "washers"
on the post.

The present version of these are 3D-printed "clip" washers that can be added
and removed without having to remove the drive.


## Variants

Past and present washer versions are as follows:

* The baseline washer is a circle with a square hole, with a thickness of
1, 2, 3, or 5 mm.

* There were two types of CNC-compatible washers designed: One had dog-bones
on the interior corners, and the other was C-shaped so that it could be
machined using a Woodruff keyway cutter.

* A variant CNC assembly arranged several washers of different thicknesses
in-plane with each other linked by sprues.

* A 3D printed assembly arranged several washers stacked on top of each
other linked by one sprue.

* The "clip" versions of the washers are also arranged in a stacked assembly
linked by one sprue, for 3D printing.

The purpose of the CNC version was to provide washers that were durable and
sterilizable, but in practice the 3D printed versions worked well enough for
our purposes (and were much, much cheaper).
