# Mechanical Proxies

## Overview

This folder contains models of mechanical proxies of each of the drive
variants in service. These are used for planning the configuration of the
drives; proxies are mounted on a mockup chamber and adjusted to have guide
tubes in the desired locations.

(The original proxy for the stock tungsten drives was made by Brainsight
in the 2010s, I think. The new proxies are intended to be 3d printed.)

The proxies have optional obstruction templates that may be attached. Without
the templates, the goal is to show where the guide tubes will be positioned
with maximum visibility. With the templates, the goal is to see whether nearby
drives will conflict with each other.
