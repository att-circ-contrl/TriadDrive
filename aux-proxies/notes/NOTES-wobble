Wobble in the proxies is bad, as this produces uncertainty about where the
guide tubes are actually positioned.

A permanent pitch due to the mechanical conflict with the mounting arms is
bad, as it introduces large positioning errors.

The slot holding the mounting rod needs to be a very close fit. If it isn't,
errors are caused by translation (relatively small as the distance is low),
and by roll (large errors due to the large distance). To reduce roll, the
height of the proxy can be extended as well (longer/deeper mounting hole).
