The nominal radius of the mounting arms that hold the drive mounting posts is
1/4" (6.35mm). The Kevin drives have a nominal circle radius of 6.5mm, as far
as I can tell.

These still conflict with the actual arms (oddly, the proxies conflict more
than the real drives do). So, the circle radius for the base cutout needs to
be at least 7mm.
