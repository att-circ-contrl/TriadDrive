The nominal radius of the mounting arms that hold the drive mounting posts is
1/4" (6.35mm). The Kevin drives have a nominal circle radius of 6.5mm, as far
as I can tell.

These still conflict with the actual arms (oddly, the proxies conflict more
than the real drives do). So, the circle radius for the base cutout needs to
be at least 7mm.

NOTE - I made the circle radius 7.5mm, and pushed the flats at the back
forward by 0.5mm. This does not match the real drive's geometry, but should
guarantee clearance around the mounting arm.
