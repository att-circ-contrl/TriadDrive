# Obsolete Hardware and Specifications

## Overview

This folder contains top-level folders for drives, auxiliary devices, and
specifications that are no longer in active service.

**NOTE** - The `v2b` drive is no longer in active service, but the "body"
and rectangular "rod" parts from it are still used with other drive variants.

**NOTE** - IGES files in these folders are likely saved as surfaces rather
than as solids, which may cause peculiarities when importing them.

## Obsolete Drives

* `drive-v2b` --
This is a long-reach drive design intended for widely-spaced Atlas probes.
This design is obsolete but the "body" part and "rod" parts are used by
subsequent designs.

* `drive-v2c` --
This is a short-reach design originally intended to mount Atlas probes in a
widely-spaced pattern. This design is obsolete.


## Obsolete Auxiliary Hardware

* `aux-drive-mounts-2021` -- These were replacement parts for clamps used
when mounting the posts that mount the Triad drives.

* `aux-v2x-tube-clamp` -- This is a guide tube clamp intended to replace the
"foot block" scheme used by the "v2b" and "v2c" drives, holding ordinary
non-flanged guide tubes.
