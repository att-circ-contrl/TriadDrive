From the email to Ali and Thilo:

As far as I can tell, this was designed using a mixture of metric and
imperial units. I stuck with metric units in the drawing to avoid confusion.

The clamping screws are #2-56 socket-head screws at 1/2" and 5/8" length,
and the screw holding the Triad post on to the arm is an M3 6mm button-head
screw with hex drive. Both types of screw use a 5/64" hex key. The Triad
post has a nominal diameter of 4mm (oversized for the round part and
undersized for the square part), and the post that mounts the clamp itself
seems to be 3/16" nominal diameter. The clamp needs to deform by up to
0.2 mm when tightened.
