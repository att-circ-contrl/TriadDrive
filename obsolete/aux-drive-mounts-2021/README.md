# Mounting Arms for Triad Drives (2020)

## Overview

The Triad drives are mounted using 4mm square posts, which are held by
S-shaped clamps, which mount to a frame that mounts to the chamber. At one
point we needed more S-shaped clamps (as one had stripped threads); this
project duplicated the original design and tested two variants of it that
were less prone to thread stripping.

The "L" shaped cut was the most reliable but has geometry that can only be
made by 3d printing or by EDM, not by milling.

The angled cut also worked and could be made by milling followed by using
a slitting saw.

We eventually ordered more clamps from the manufacturer instead.
