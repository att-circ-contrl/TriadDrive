# Hand-Loading Jig for NeuroNexus Probes


## Overview

This folder contains drawings and models for a jig used to load NeuroNexus
probes into guide tubes.

**NOTE** - This is presently also used to load Diagnostic BioChip probes
into guide tubes, but the probe holding part needs to be shimmed on the
bottom with masking tape in order to have the correct alignment.


## Using the Jig

To use the jig:
* Clamp the guide tube on to the right (moving) block. Move it a safe
distance away.
* Place the probe on the left (fixed) block. The green tab on the NeuroNexus
probes can be placed to stand up in one of the grooves in the rubber
portion; for DBC probes, just rest the card on the rubber.
* Holding the probe in place with a fingertip, clamp it down.
* Put the surgical loupe on. You're going to have to align the probe tip and
guide tube by eye.
* Move the guide tube closer to the probe. When the probe tip and the
entrance to the guide tube are near each other, ensure that they are aligned
by applying gentle pressure to the mounting blocks (they can deform slightly),
and/or by applying gentle pressure to the clamp holding the probe (the probe
will bow slightly, adjusting its height).
* When the probe and guide tube are aligned, bring them together.
* When the probe is fully inserted, hold the probe and guide tube in place
with a fingertip and un-clamp both.
* Remove the probe and guide tube by holding the guide tube with forceps,
keeping it tilted up so that gravity moves the probe into the tube instead
of out of the tube. Hold the green tab (NN) or circuit board (DBC) with
forceps to prevent it from pulling on the thin flex.


## Miscellaneous Notes

* Some or all of the IGES models will have been exported as surfaces rather
than solids.
