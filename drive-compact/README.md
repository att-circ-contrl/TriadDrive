# Miniature Single-Probe Drive

## Overview

This is a proof-of-concept design for a manual drive that uses the same
principles as the 2018 "semi-chronic" paperclip-sized drive, but with parts
that are easier to make and to assemble.

These are driven using a hex-drive screw that's coupled to the drive rod.
The intention is that a motorized hex driver could be placed above the drive
to allow computer-controlled driving. Hex-drive is also far less slip-prone
than flat-bladed driving for manual drive, and doesn't require pressure like
Phillips does.


## Notes

* Natural widths from assembly screw lengths are 2.4mm (3/32"), 3.2mm (1/8"),
and 4.8mm (3/16").

* Another width constraint is side wall thickness for the drive screw and
alignment pins. The drive screws are 1.5mm wide (#0-80) and the bushing tubes
around the alignment pins are 2.1mm (14ga) or 2.4mm (13ga) wide, for 1/16"
pins.

* Minimum collar width is 4mm, with D-profile shafts and 1/16" set screws.
For anything narrower, the drive shaft and drive screw will have to be
brazed or welded together inside a coupling tube.

* Natural height of the alignment pin holding frame is 1/4" (6.35mm).
Useful minimum is 5mm. Natural depth of the bottom is about 15mm (much more
and it starts conflicting with tissue, depending on location).

* Drive rod length is 1", 1-1/2", or 2", from McMaster-Carr.

* Drive screw length for socket-head is 1/2" if 316, or up to 1-1/2" 18-8.
