# Procedures for Using Drives and Accessories

This folder holds miscellaneous how-to documents for using the equipment.
Additional short notes and reference documents can be found in the "`notes`"
folder.


Documents describing active equipment:

* `triad-drive-disassembly-stock.pdf` --
This describes how to take apart a Kevin-style drive. Similar methods are
used for assembling and disassembling variant drives.


Documents for obsolete equipment:

* `loading-v2b-atlas.pdf` --
This describes how to load Atlas probes into the "v2b" long-reach wide-spaced
drive. This is an unreliable process and the "v2b" drive has been superseded
by the close-spaced long-reach drive.

* `loading-v2c-atlas.pdf` --
This describes how to load Atlas probes into the "v2c" short-reach wide-spaced
drive. This is an unreliable process, the "v2c" drive has been superseded by
the close-spaced short-reach drive, and the short-reach drives hold the
Atlas probes too high to be useful (Atlas probes need long-reach drives).
