# Chris's Copy of Kia's Long-Reach Drive

## Overview

The close-spaced long-reach drive was modified by one of our postdocs
(Kia) to work more effectively with his setup. This is my annotated copy
of the parts that were put into service.

NOTE - In the future I may CAD up my own versions of these, optionally with
modifications. For now, it's just a handy way of determining which parts
were actually used out of the many variants in Kia's dev tree.

Salient changes that Kia made:

* Drive components were mostly compatible with filament-printing (he used
that for prototyping).

* Drive feet were modified to be as flat as possible, for optimum access
to sites near the side of the chamber.

* Kia used captive nuts and epoxied-in-place nuts in lieu of hand-threading
holes. This solved the durability problem with holes that were threaded in
plastic.
