As far as I can tell from photographs and invoices and datestamps, the parts
symlinked here and listed below were the ones in service in 2023/2024. There
were many versions of the files, so misidentification is possible:


SLEVES.stl  - Drive body sleeve.

foot.stl  - Long-reach foot.
Clamp_Merged.stl  - Guide tube clamp for the front of the foot.
Clamp_Middle.stl  - Guide tube clamp for the rear of the foot.

armLat_01.stl - Lower L/R arms used with Kevin-style metal clips.
(No middle arm with Kevin clips?)

ARM_UP_LAT_04.stl - Lower L/R arms used with plastic clips.
middle_arm_02.stl - Lower middle arm used with plastic clips.

Arm_Lat_clamps_02.stl - Plastic clips used with L/R arms.
side_clamp_01.stl - Plastic clip used with middle arm (FIXME - unconfirmed).

Arm_LR.stl - Upper L/R arm. (FIXME - Threading is backwards?)
(I can't find the middle upper arm.)


(This is the end of the file.)
