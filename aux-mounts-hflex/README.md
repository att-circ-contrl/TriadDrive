# Cable Mounts for Heavy Flex

## Overview

These folders contain models and drawings of cable mounts intended to hold
the "card" ends of the "heavy flex" cables, securing the ends of the cables
to the Triad drives.

The cable mounts replace the mounting clip on the Triad drive (holding the
drive to its mounting post).


## Notes

* The single-slot sides anchor the heavy flex cables using a 5/16" #0-80
flat-head screw. The two-slot sides use a 7/16" #0-80 flat-head screw.

* Be careful installing the screws. There's only about 1mm of threaded
area, and it's easily stripped.

* **To fix:** The trench at the back of the drive needs to be shallower
(optionally recessing the body inset further as well). Right now there's
about 0.1mm of clearance between the mount and the Triad drive, which is
sometimes not enough to securely clamp the mounting post. A shallower trench
with 0.3mm of clearance would allow the mounting screws to be tightened
further.
