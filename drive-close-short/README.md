# Close-Spaced Short-Reach Drive

## Overview

This is a modification of the "stock" Triad drive that replaces the foot
and the arms (in the same manner as the "v2c" variant did). It keeps the
original "narrow" body.

"Silicon" arms with holes to screw in flanged probes were made, but were a
pain to use, and it turned out that NeuroNexus probes can be held by the
clips Kevin provided to us (albeit at risk of metal fatigue). So, only the
"tungsten" arms are needed with this design.

This design can work with tungsten, NeuroNexus, and Diagnostic BioChip
probes, with appropriate cable holders.


## Variants

The following variants are in service:

* The "stacked" foot is the original version, with the middle guide tube
clip raised above the side clips. The central guide tube is held with a
flat "6p5" clip and the side guide tubes are held with "J-clip" clips.

* The "1pc" low-profile foot uses a single clamp to hold all three guide
tubes. It's difficult to individually adjust guide tubes with this drive,
and removing any guide tube requires removing the clamp.

* The "3pc" low-profile foot uses three clamps to hold the guide tubes, with
the middle clamp screwing into the side clamps rather than into the base of
the drive. In principle the guide tubes can be individually adjusted with
this setup (though adjusting any screw alters pressure on all three clamps).
Removing either of the side guide tubes requires first removing the middle
clamp.


## Notes

* The IGES files for the foot and J-clip are surfaces, not solids.
* I think Isaac's exported arms are solids but I'm not certain.
* The original version (from 2021-11-04, with Z-clips) didn't work; the
clips would slide off of the guide tubes. The J-clips fixed this (from
2021-11-18).
* FIXME - As of 2022-04-21, I'm not sure either the 1pc or 3pc clamps will
work (untested). The 1pc one might have difficulty grabbing the middle tube
due to bowing, and the 3pc one may have difficulty grabbing the side tubes
when the middle clamp is tightened and/or difficulty installing the middle
clamp when the side clamps are tightened.


_This is the end of the file._
