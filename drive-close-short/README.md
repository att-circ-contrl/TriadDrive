# Close-Spaced Short-Reach Drive

## Overview

This is a modification of the "stock" Triad drive that replaces the foot
and the arms (in the same manner as the "v2c" variant did). It keeps the
original "narrow" body.

"Silicon" arms with holes to screw in flanged probes were made, but were a
pain to use, and it turned out that NeuroNexus probes can be held by the
clips Kevin provided to us (albeit at risk of metal fatigue). So, only the
"tungsten" arms are needed with this design.

This design can work with tungsten, NeuroNexus, and Diagnostic BioChip
probes, with appropriate cable holders.


## Notes

* The IGES files for the foot and J-clip are surfaces, not solids.
* I think Isaac's exported arms are solids but I'm not certain.
* The original version (from 2021-11-04, with Z-clips) didn't work; the
clips would slide off of the guide tubes. The J-clips fixed this (from
2021-11-18).


_This is the end of the file._
