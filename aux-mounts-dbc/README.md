# Board Mounts for Diagnostic BioChips Probes

## Overview

These folders contain models and drawings of board mounts intended to hold
the boards and ZIF-clips used with Diagnostic BioChips probes. The boards
screw into the mounts and the ZIF-clips clip on to the boards.

The board mounts replace the mounting clip on the Triad drive (holding the
drive to its mounting post).


## Notes

* These are intended to be 3d printed in a rigid plastic. Nylon and printed
polypropylene flex too much at the mounting posts.

* The new versions of these mounts attach Kevin-style. The two faces on
each side of the post aren't flush with each other. One mates with the
drive, leaving a small amount of clearance in the post channel. The the
other has clearance, allowing the clamp to bend as the screw is tightened
until the post and channel fully engage with each other.

* There are multiple versions of the mounts, with different post channel
widths. Choose the version that has the least clearance around the post.
Different versions are identified by different markings.
