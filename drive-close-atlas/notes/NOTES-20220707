Feature requests from the 7 July 2022 tests:

- Have a way to access the flange screw on the blue probe/rod assembly.
  This either means mounting that probe on the opposite side of the rod or
  mounting that probe at 30 degrees instead of 45 degrees so that the screw
  is accessible from across the drive.

(Update: Confirmed that the blue flange screw isn't accessible, and that with
30 degree arms it probably would be.)

- Shorten the rods by 30mm to avoid conflict with the headpost and frame.
  NOTE - This may make it difficult to grab the rod off of the jig. The rod
  can be a bit longer than this or the jig can be shorted so that the rod
  can still project past the end for pickup.

(Update: Confirmed that 30mm shorter is okay with the existing jig, with
about 10mm overhang. 25mm shorter (15mm overhang) is probably better.)


(This is the end of the file.)
