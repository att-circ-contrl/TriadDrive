Feature requests from the 7 July 2022 tests:

- Have a way to access the flange screw on the blue probe/rod assembly.
  This either means mounting that probe on the opposite side of the rod or
  mounting that probe at 30 degrees instead of 45 degrees so that the screw
  is accessible from across the drive.

- Shorten the rods by 30mm to avoid conflict with the headpost and frame.
  NOTE - This may make it difficult to grab the rod off of the jig. The rod
  can be a bit longer than this or the jig can be shorted so that the rod
  can still project past the end for pickup.


(This is the end of the file.)
