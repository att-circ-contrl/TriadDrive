Problems reported:

- The screw on the middle probe can conflict with the ridge on the foot.
This has already been narrowed in CAD to fix that problem.

- The 3d printed guide tube arms deflect. The side ones deflect symmetrically
and are well below the lowest probe flange location, so this is tolerable,
but the middle arm deflects by up to 0.5mm as well. This puts the guide tube
out of alignment with the probe close to where the probe is held. This
deflection took time to happen, and was made worse by loading only one side
tube (the deflected side tube arm pushed the middle guide tube, adding stress
to the middle tube's arm).

- Proto Labs can machine metal versions of the foot as-is, if necessary.
