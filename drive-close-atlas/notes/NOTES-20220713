From 13 July 2022 bench tests:

- The side guide tube mounts are deflecting inward when tightened, pinching
off the middle channel.

- Guide tubes move inward by about 0.4mm. The probe mounts have enough
compliance to tolerate this, but it's very much not an ideal situation.

- Machining the foot out of PEEK probably won't fix this, as the PEEK clips
bow when tightened and are about the same thickness.

- Machining the foot, or the bottom of the foot, out of steel would probably
work but has its own problems.

- The deflection also causes a discrepancy between the model's position for
the probe sites and the actual position.
